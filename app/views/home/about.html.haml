        %p
          Long ago, in a distant galaxy ... the Old Republic fell. On its ruins, the Sith Order created a galactic Empire, subduing one planetary system after another. The Alliance forces seek to overthrow the Dark Emperor and restore free rule in the galaxy. General Obi-Wan Kenobi returns after years of seclusion to once again face off against the Lord of Darkness Darth Vader. Together with him on the bright side of the Force - the young pilot Luke, the son of Anakin Skywalker, Princess Senator Leia Organa, the legendary Correlian smuggler Han Solo and his friend the Wookiee Chewbacca.
