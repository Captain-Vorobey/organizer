# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* I think the most difficult task was a realization of logic adding orders 
  and setting their time with all conditionals(time limits and validations for time slots)

* I have several examples of interesting tasks which I met on my way. 
  There are a facebook authentification and as I said before it is a task with time slots. 
  Theese approuches were new for me and I learnt how to decide problems associated with theese goals.
  
* If I had more time, then I would be able to make the styles more attractive 
  and finish the deploy on heroku without errors also do autocomplete search
  and maybe refactor my code a little to make him more readable 
  and satisfies the requirements
  
  To start working with a project write the following commands:
    - bundle install
    - rails db:create
    - rails db:migrate
    - rails db:seed
    - rails s
  And enjoy.
